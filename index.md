# CSV Soundsystem (London Edition)

We are a weekly meetup for people who enjoy coding, civic responsibility and fun times.

We meet on **Tuesdays at 6:30pm at the [Barbican](https://www.barbican.org.uk/visitor-information)**, usually on the ground floor. It's a bit of a maze, so you might need to wander around for a while.

[CSV Soundsystem](https://twitter.com/csvsoundsystem) was [founded](http://csv.nyc/) in New York City.
